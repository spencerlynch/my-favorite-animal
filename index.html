       <p>  All too often do people choose a lion, shark, eagle or other type predatious animal as their favorite animal, but I am different. My favorite animal is the gentle manatee. The manatee goes about it's day grazing on sea plants and making friends with other organisms in the habitat. Often referred to as the sea cow, they are known for their slow and peaceful demeanor.</p>

        <p>  I won a trip to Los Angeles when I was younger from an essay on tactics to get them off the <a href= "https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=A007">endangered species list</a>, and have had a strange fascination with them since. Having recently been removed from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife endangered species list, things seem to be looking up for the ole sea cow.</p>
